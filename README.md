This is a simple log parser tool that filters log files for certain keywords, then spits them out in a text document.

Once you've installed the ZIP, double-click the file called `logspitter`. This will launch the Terminal.

You may need to enter your password and/or authorize it via your Mac's Security and Privacy section. 

(NOTE: if you've previously installed the tool, run the 'UNINSTALL' script first.)

To use the Log Spitter, simply open a Terminal and type "logspitter", then at the prompt, drag in the log file and hit Enter. You may also double-click the `logspitter` file.

Once you hit Enter, it will open a new text file with the relevant keywords.

(Note: if the text file doesn't open, move/copy the log file to your desktop and run logspitter again. This will eliminate any possible issues with conflicting file paths.)

Once the text file with the filtered keywords is open, Logspitter will ask if you want to open the original Log file. Simply type "y" or "n" at the prompt, and the original file will open.
