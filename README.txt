This is a simple log parser tool that searches log files for certain keywords, then spits them out in a text document.

Once you've installed the ZIP, double-click the file called "installation". This will launch the Terminal.

You may need to enter your password and/or authorize it via your Mac's Security and Privacy section. 

(If you like, you can then delete the downloaded folder, as the relevant files have been copied to your system.)


To use the Log Spitter, simply open a Terminal and type "logspitter", then drag in the log file and hit Enter.

It should look something like this:

"logspitter qt.log"

Once you hit Enter, it should open a text document with the relevant keywords.

(Note: if the text file doesn't open, move/copy the log file to your desktop and run logspitter again. This will eliminate any possible issues with conflicting file paths.)
