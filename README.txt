This is a simple log parser tool that searches log files for certain keywords, then spits them out in a text document.

Once you've installed the ZIP, double-click the "installation" file. You may need to enter your password to authorize it and allow the download via your Mac's Security and Privacy section. 

You can then delete the downloaded folder, as the relevant files have been copied to your system.

To use the Log Spitter, simply open a Terminal and enter "logspitter", then drag the log file in and hit enter.

It should look something like this:

logspitter qt.log

Once you hit Enter, it should open a text document with the relevant keywords.
