This is a simple log parser tool that filters log files for certain keywords, then spits them out in a text document.

Once you've installed the ZIP, double-click the file called "INSTALL". This will launch the Terminal.

You may need to enter your password and/or authorize it via your Mac's Security and Privacy section. 

(While the install script is primariy meant for Mac OS X, the logspitter itself will run on any unix/linux system).

(NOTE: if you've previously installed the tool, run the UNINSTALL script first.)

To use the Log Spitter, simply open a Terminal and type "logspitter", then at the prompt, drag in the log file and hit Enter.

Once you hit Enter, it will open a new text file with the relevant keywords.

(Note: if the text file doesn't open, move/copy the log file to your desktop and run logspitter again. This will eliminate any possible issues with conflicting file paths.)
